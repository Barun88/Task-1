Task Note – Foundation & Environment Setup
Objective

Build fundamentals in cybersecurity, networking, cryptography, and set up a professional hacking lab.

1. Cybersecurity Basics

Learn CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.

Explore Threat Types: phishing, malware, DoS/DDoS, SQLi, brute force, ransomware.

Study Attack Vectors: social engineering, wireless attacks, insider threats.

Deliverable: Short notes on CIA Triad and 2–3 examples of real-world attacks.

2. Lab Environment Setup

Install VirtualBox/VMware.

Install Kali Linux as attacker machine.

Install Metasploitable2 or DVWA as target machine.

Configure private lab network (Host-Only Adapter).

Deliverable: Screenshot of running Kali + target VM on same network.

3. Linux Fundamentals

File navigation (cd, ls, pwd).

File/Directory permissions (chmod, chown).

Package management (apt, dpkg).

Networking commands (ifconfig, ping, netstat, traceroute).

Deliverable: Linux command cheat sheet (custom notes).

4. Networking Basics

OSI model layers & functions.

TCP/IP protocol suite.

DNS & HTTP/HTTPS (deep dive).

IP addressing, subnetting, NAT.

Deliverable: Short summary of OSI + TCP/IP mapping.

5. Cryptography Basics

Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption.

Hashing (MD5, SHA256).

Digital certificates & SSL/TLS.

Hands-on: Encrypt/Decrypt messages using OpenSSL.

Deliverable: Screenshot of OpenSSL encryption/decryption.

6. Tool Familiarization

Wireshark (packet capture).

Nmap (network scanning).

Netcat (network debugging).

Metasploit basics.

Deliverable: Capture log from Wireshark and output of Nmap scan.
